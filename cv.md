## **Code example:**

**Terms of KATA from CodeWars:** In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

My solution:

```
function highAndLow(numbers){
    let arr = numbers.split(' ');
    
    arr.sort(function(a, b) {
        return a - b;
    });
  
    return `${arr[arr.length - 1]} ${arr[0]}`
}

```
